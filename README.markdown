HerzultForumBundle
==================

A simple forum for your Symfony application.

**This Bundle is quite old, doesn't respect the newest best practices and uses some deprecated calls. It's only here because of legacy, but usage in new projects is not recommended!**

## Dependencies

## Documentation

The documentation can be found in the `Resources/doc` directory.
